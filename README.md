# **Sloth Yoga**

## **Overview**

Sloth Yoga is a site for kids yoga studio based in Dublin, Ireland. Based in Castleknock, Dublin we are never too far away. The idea about yoga studio for kids was born after our son was struggling to regulate his emotions, therefore getting upset and angry very often. With my yoga and an exercise knowledge, we started a fun and exiting journey of helping many more. We are passionate about yoga and benefits it gives to not only adults but children alike. The goal of website is to draw interest to Sloth Yoga studio, while highlighting benefits of becoming a yogi. Yoga is for everyone but promoting healthy habits and self care to kids at early age through yoga practise builds basis of healthier lifestyle.

### **Color Scheme**

For color scheme I chose blue and yellow tones but kept them to a minimum to keep website light and showcase info and images. Blue color is known for friendly, inviting and calming emotions, yellow is associated with joy and friendliness.

### **Fonts**

After checking Great vibes font for headers I noticed it gives too elegant look and doesn't suit the style so I changed header font to Montserrat Alternates Regular as it feels more fitting for the site and kept Montserrat Alternates Light for content for clean look and easy readability. I decided to choose charcoal color for font after learning during Love Running project that it is easier to read for people with poor eyesight.
